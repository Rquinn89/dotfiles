Set of files helping to set up my desired configuration on a given unix/mac system. (But these were set up on MacOS so some things
may be a bit off for Linux.)

Plus a few scripts

The high level .vimrc, .zshrc, etc should generally go in ~/. 
They all source organized config files layered in the .dotfiles/ directory.

The .dotfiles directory should also go in ~/.

I've tried to put settings **requiring** a plugin to work at the bottom so I can easily get these working by commenting out the end sections if I move to a new computer / re-install my current OS.
